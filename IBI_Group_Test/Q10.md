The output of the code will be:
1
4
2
3

Explanation:

- console.log(1);: This line is executed first and logs 1 to the console.

- setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);: This line schedules a callback function (printNumber) to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Despite the delay being 0, the callback doesn't execute immediately. Instead, it gets placed in the callback queue and will be executed after the current call stack is empty. The third argument 2 is passed as an argument to the printNumber function.

- setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);: This line schedules another callback function (printNumber) to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. It also gets placed in the callback queue.

- console.log(4);: This line is executed after the first setTimeout and logs 4 to the console.

Now, let's see the order of execution:

- console.log(1);: This is executed first and logs 1 to the console.
- console.log(4);: This is executed next and logs 4 to the console.
- Callback from setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);: The callback is executed next because the delay was set to 0 milliseconds. It logs 2 to the console.
Callback from setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);: The callback is executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. It logs 3 to the console.

Even though the first setTimeout was set to 0 milliseconds, it still waits for the current call stack to finish executing before it runs its callback. The event loop checks the callback queue for pending callbacks only when the call stack is empty. Therefore, the callback with the delay of 0 milliseconds executes after the console.log(4) statement.

The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in that order when the code is executed.

Let's break down the execution step by step:

- console.log(1);: The number 1 is logged to the console immediately.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);: This line schedules a callback function to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). However, it doesn't block the execution of the subsequent code. So, the rest of the code continues to execute.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);: This line schedules another callback function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Despite the delay being 0, it still gets added to the callback queue, but it won't be executed immediately. It will wait for the current call stack to finish executing.

- console.log(4);: The number 4 is logged to the console immediately after the previous line, before any of the scheduled callbacks execute.

Now, let's see the order of execution:

- console.log(1);: This is executed first and logs "1" to the console.

- console.log(4);: This is executed next and logs "4" to the console.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);: Although this was scheduled to run with a delay of 0 milliseconds, it gets placed in the callback queue, and since the call stack is currently executing, it waits until the current call stack is empty.

- The call stack is empty now, and the event loop checks the callback queue for any pending callbacks. It finds the callback from setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); and executes it. It logs "3" to the console.

- setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);: This was scheduled to run after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, so it will be executed after 1 second. It logs "2" to the console after the delay.

So, the final order of logging is: 1, 4, 3, 2.
